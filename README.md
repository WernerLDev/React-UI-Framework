# WerlangUI
This is a simple work-in-progress UI framework built for React applications. Non of the existing UI frameworks really satisfy me completly. Bootstrap is too much focussed on websites and styling, FabricUI can only be used to built applications that intergrate with MS Office365 products, KendoUI is not free and opensource.

This resulted in me trying to create my own framework. The idea behind this framework is that you can compose interfaces without having to write too much HTML and CSS. At the same time all the components should be advanced enough for the needs of people building more complex interfaces for SPAs. 


## Installation
As soon as I published the first version you should be able to add this application using npm or yarn.
