# WerlangUI
This is a simple work-in-progress UI framework built for React applications. Most existing frontend frameworks such as bootstrap seem to be focussing a lot on styling and websites. For my own projects I needed a simple framework that would allow me to compose interfaces for applications easily. With that I wanted to have more advanced UI components as well. A datagrid with resizable columns for example. With this project I aim to build a UI framework specifically designed for application interfaces that need to look and feel more like a desktop applications.


## Components
Right now this package contains the following components:

* TreeView
* DataGrid
* SideMenu
* MenuBar
* ContextMenu
* Splitpane

... More to come.

## Screenshot
Here is an example interface I am using to test the components currently:

## Installation
As soon as I published the first version you should be able to add this application using npm or yarn.
